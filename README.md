# Online News Aggregator with Text-to-Speech
The Online News Aggregator is a web application designed to collect and display the latest news from multiple trusted sources, such as **Times of India** and **Hindustan Times**, in one centralized platform. The project provides a user-friendly interface for accessing real-time news articles, along with an added Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature, which reads out the news aloud to the user for an enhanced experience.

## Features:
- **News Aggregation**: The project aggregates news from popular news websites, such as Times of India and Hindustan Times, and displays the latest headlines in a well-organized layout.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: By integrating the Web Speech API, the application allows users to listen to the news content instead of reading it. Each news headline is accompanied by a “Speak” button that triggers the text-to-speech functionality.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap, the website is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, making it accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Easy Navigation**: The platform provides an intuitive and interactive user interface, where users can refresh the news feed with the "Refresh News" button.
- **Attractive UI**: The UI is designed with a royal blue header for a professional look, and the buttons are highlighted in an orange-yellow color, ensuring clarity and an elegant aesthetic.

## Technologies Used:
1. **HTML/CSS** for the structure and styling of the web pages.
2. **Bootstrap 4** for responsive design and UI components.
3. **JavaScript** to handle interactions and enable text-to-speech functionality.
4. **Django** (depending on your implementation) to handle the server-side logic and serve the news data.
5. **Web Speech API** for the text-to-speech functionality.
6. **Python Libraries** (like **requests**, **beautifulsoup4**) for web scraping and fetching news data from online sources.

## How It Works:
1. When a user visits the platform, the website automatically fetches the latest headlines from specified news sources.
2. The news content is displayed in columns, categorized by source (e.g., Times of India or Hindustan Times).
3. The user can click on the "Speak" button next to each headline to hear the content being read aloud.
4. The "Refresh News" button can be used to fetch the latest headlines from the sources again.
